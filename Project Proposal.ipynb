    "## Goal for this project:\n",
    "I'm hoping to explore this rich dataset to find some form of clustering in differnet hobbies and phobias as of 2013 amongst \"young\" people, it would be interesting to see if a pattern arises in such an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link to Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is an opensource kaggle dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey#responses.csv\n",

    "## Possible Biases for the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data has been collected from a restricted group \"students who take a particualr staistics class, and their friends\", this data may not translate well to all sects of \"young people\"\n",
    "- This dataset does not record the age of domeone who takes the survey, young people need not necessarily have young friends\n",
    "- This dataset has some preset hobbies and phobias that \"young\" people will rate as interesting, there could be certain hobbies or phobias that are not explored in this dataset."
