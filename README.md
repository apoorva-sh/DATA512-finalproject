# DATA 512 FINAL PROJECT 

## Goal for this project:
To look at the relation ship between music and various emotions (as an initial response)

## Link to Dataset:

The dataset is available at: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IFOBRN

## Data Description

The dataset contains an initial average emotional response to a factorially altered music clip (7 features of a music clip are altered and the first emotional response is recorded for each version of the clip. the 7 features being Register, Mode, Tempo, Sound level, Articulation, Timbre, Melody)

## License for Dataset:

The license is listed as CC0: Public Domain as listed in the "Terms" section of the data description

## Possible Biases for the data:

- I could not find a specification as to who the study was conducted on, emotional responses can have other listener specific responses
- The initial sound wave that is altered factorially could also affect the emotional response/feel of a song
