# DATA 512 FINAL PROJECT 

## Goal for this project:
I'm hoping to explore this rich dataset to find some form of clustering in differnet hobbies and phobias as of 2013 amongst "young" people, it would be interesting to see if a pattern arises in such an analysis.

## Link to Dataset:

The dataset is an opensource kaggle dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey#responses.csv

## License for Dataset:

The license is listed as CC0: Public Domain : https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/metadata

## Possible Biases for the data:

- The data has been collected from a restricted group "students who take a particualr staistics class, and their friends", this data may not translate well to all sects of "young people"
- This dataset does not record the age of domeone who takes the survey, young people need not necessarily have young friends
- This dataset has some preset hobbies and phobias that "young" people will rate as interesting, there could be certain hobbies or phobias that are not explored in this dataset.
