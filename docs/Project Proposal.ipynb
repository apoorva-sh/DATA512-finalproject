    "# DATA 512 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal for this project:\n",
    "To look at the relation ship between music and various emotions (as an initial response)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link to Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available at: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IFOBRN\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains an initial average emotional response to a factorially altered music clip (7 features of a music clip are altered and the first emotional response is recorded for each version of the clip. the 7 features being Register, Mode, Tempo, Sound level, Articulation, Timbre, Melody)\n",
    "\n",
    "## License for Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The license is listed as CC0: Public Domain as listed in the \"Terms\" section of the data description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Biases for the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could not find a specification as to who the study was conducted on, emotional responses can have other listener specific responses\n",
    "- The initial sound wave that is altered factorially could also affect the emotional response/feel of a song"
